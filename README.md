# mULTI-cHECK - Archive Tester for FAME & AMIEX BBS Systems

This is the source code of my archive tester for FAME and AMIEX BBS systems.

It is written in Amiga-E, a very fast and nice structured language I've used a lot together with C.

To compile the code you need the Amiga-E development files, the code can be compiled with:

```
ec mULTI-cHECK.e
```
